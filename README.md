Goal: Create a linear regression that will use previous Metacritic data for actors and core crew members to predict the Metacritic score for films. 

Motivation: Prior to the pandemic beginning in spring, I was looking forward to the summer of 2020 because Christopher Nolan was finally releasing his next film. After March that anticipation faded as New York City shutdown and didn't reopened until the early summer month. The film industry took massive losses on films such as "Birds of Prey," taking in a total gross of 200 million dollars when the breakeven for the film would have been 250-300 million dollars. Birds of Prey had a sequal that was in development that has sense been shut down by Hollywood studios due to the massive loss companies suffered because of the lacking box office. I wanted to create a model that could predict the Metacritic score of a film based on the previous performance of movies. I thought to myself about how production companies and other financing bodies for films could make up for the loss that they would continue to suffer as the pandemic continued on as they were forced movies to be released only to gross far less than they would in a normal summer film season, as well as being forced into shelving films until they could have a wide release when the pandemic ended.
