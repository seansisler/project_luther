## Goal
Create a linear regression that will use previous Metacritic data for actors and core crew members to predict the Metacritic score for films. 

## Motivation
Prior to the pandemic beginning in spring, I was looking forward to the summer of 2020 because Christopher Nolan was finally releasing his next film. After March that anticipation faded as New York City shutdown and didn't reopened until the early summer month. The film industry took massive losses on films such as "Birds of Prey," taking in a total gross of 200 million dollars when the breakeven for the film would have been 250-300 million dollars. Birds of Prey had a sequal that was in development that has sense been shut down by Hollywood studios due to the massive loss companies suffered because of the lacking box office. I wanted to create a model that could predict the Metacritic score of a film based on the previous performance of movies. I thought to myself about how production companies and other financing bodies for films could make up for the loss that they would continue to suffer as the pandemic continued on as they were forced movies to be released only to gross far less than they would in a normal summer film season, as well as being forced into shelving films until they could have a wide release when the pandemic ended. 

## Data
My dataset was scrapped from Metacritic using Beautiful Soup. This proved to be more difficult than with practice that I had scrapping from websites that don't have restrictions on how much you can scrape, such as Wikipedia. I used CloudScraper to help scrape more and used the Requests library to use a header for the html request that I was making. I also used the sessions object to send my requests with cookies as a last effort. In the end I scraped every movie that Metacritic had in the database. From each movie I used the user score, the metascore, and all of the cast and crew information. 
I created a database for my data in Postgres with four tables: cast and crew credits, film details (runtime, release date, language), and finally the films with their metacritic score and userscore. I created my main features for analysis by using a film's release date and all of the actors in the film to create three features, prinicple cast mean previous Metascore, supporting cast mean previous Metascore, and then the mean of all the scores combined. I did the same with the crew having 4 features in the end: directors mean previous metascore, writers, producers, and then all other crew members were pooled together for an other crew members mean metascore variable. I did the same with the userscores to create the same seven features.
